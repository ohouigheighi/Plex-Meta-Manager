# Overlay Defaults

There are many Default Overlay Files built into Kometa itself which offer an easy-to-use and customizable set of 
Overlays that the user can achieve without having to worry about creating the files that makes the overlays possible.

This is the simplest way to create Overlays using Kometa.

## Configurations

To run a default Kometa Overlay file you can simply add it to your `overlay_files` using `default` like so:

```yaml
libraries:
  Movies:
    overlay_files:
      - default: ribbon
      - default: ratings
```

### Example Poster Overlays

**Note: These examples use fonts not packaged with Kometa. See [bullmoose20's Configs](https://github.com/Kometa-Team/Community-Configs/tree/master/bullmoose20)**

## Rating Overlays

By default, for Movies in Plex, the `Ratings Source` dropdown (`#3`) below, can come from Rotten Tomatoes (and includes 
Critic Ratings and Audience Ratings) or IMDb (Audience Ratings). This only changes the tiny icons displayed and where 
Plex will retrieve the ratings from upon initial scan and import of the media metadata.

**Kometa can insert up to three ratings of your choice into the three spots regardless of what you choose in the 
`Advanced` tab of that Plex library**

![](images/ratings_source.png)

Plex has three available spots in the Plex DB to store ratings and thus Kometa can be used to insert ratings sources of 
your choice into those spots. They are known as the User Rating (`#1`), Critic Rating (`#2`), and Audience Rating (`#3`). 

**Note that the little icons cannot be changed and that the numbers next to the little icons are reflected in the poster 
ratings overlay**

![](images/ratings_spot.png)

To be able to insert the ratings you want, Kometa operations need to be defined. In this example below, User ratings 
(`#1`) are being filled with Rotten Tomatoes Critics Ratings. Critic ratings (`#2`) are filled with IMDb, and Audience 
ratings (`#3`) are filled with TMDb.

**mass_*_rating_update** sources can be found here: [operations](../config/operations.md)

![](images/ratings_operations.png)

Finally, to show the ratings on the poster, the following was added to the `overlay_files` section in the `config.yml` 
file to post Rotten Tomatoes Critics Ratings in (`#1`), IMDb ratings in (`#2`), and TMDb ratings in (`#3`)

![](images/ratings_overlay_path.png)

## Customizing Configs

Configs can be customized using the `template_variables` attribute when calling the file. These `template_variables` 
will be given to every template call in the file which allows them to affect how that file runs.

This example changes the ratings overlay to work on episodes.

```yaml
libraries:
  TV Shows:
    overlay_files:
      - default: ratings
        template_variables:
          builder_level: episode
```

Each file has a page on the wiki showing the available `template_variables` for each file. For example the default 
`default: ratings` has a page [here](overlays/ratings.md).

**In addition to the defined `template_variables` almost all default Overlay files have access to the 
[Shared Variables](collection_variables.md).**
